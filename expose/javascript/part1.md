# Question 1

20; since it prints result which is assigned num1 + num2 (10 + 10) = 20

# Question 2

20; since result variable is defined by "var" keyword its scope is function level meaning this log will print what line 7 assigned.

# Question 3

20; since it prints result which is assigned num1 + num2 (10 + 10) = 20

# Question 4

# Question 6

it will error out since it's assigning to const variable again at line 5.
