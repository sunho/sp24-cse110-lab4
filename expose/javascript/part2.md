# Question 1

It will print 3 as the final value of i after for loop is 3 and it's defined by "var;" it's accessible at line 12

# Question 2

It will print 150 which was the last calculated value of discountedPrice at line 7 (discountedPrice is "var" variable which is accessible here)

# Question 3
 
It will print 150 which was the last calculated value of finalPrice at line 8 (finalPrice is "var" variable which is accessible here)

# Question 4

`[50,100,150]` will be returned which is discounted price array evaluated inside the for loop body

# Question 5

It will print undefined as i is not defined at that scope (i defined in line 5 is defined by "let" which is block scope)

# Question 6

It will print undefined as discountedPrice is not defined at that scope.

# Question 7

It will print 150 which was the last calculated value of finalPrice at line 8.

# Question 8

`[50,100,150]` will be returned which is discounted price array evaluated inside the for loop body

# Question 9

It will print undefined as i is not defined at that scope.

# Question 10

It will print "3" which is length of prices

# Question 11

`[50,100,150]` will be returned which is discounted price array evaluated inside the for loop body

# Question 12

A. `student.name`
B. `student['Grad Year']`
C. `student.greeting()`
D. `student['Favorite Teacher'].name`
E. `student.courseLoad[0]`

# Question 13

A. `'32'`2 converted to string and string concat
B. `1` 3 converted to int and integer subtraction
C. `3` null converted to zero
D. `'3null'` null converted to string 'null'
E. `4` true converted to 1
F. `0` false and null converted to 0
G. `'3undefined'` undefined converted to string
H. NaN 3 converted to int and undefined converted to NaN

# Question 14

A. true 2 converted to int
B. false string conmparison
C. true '2' converted to int
D. false plain comparison
E. false plain comparison
F. true plain comparison (boolean(2) is true)

# Question 15

== does comparison after doing type coercion but === does not

# Question 17

modify function will call specified callback function on each element of array and push "transformed" element to new array.

callback provided multiplies two to given element. We are giving it input array of `[1,2,3]`. Hence, output will be `[2,4,6]`
